                <h2>Geojit Financial Services</h2>
                <p>Geojit is a legacy retail financial services company primarily based in South India. Historically focused on equity broking, it has transitioned into wealth management, distribution of financial products, and online trading platforms.</p>
                <h3>Strengths</h3>
                <p>In a world where broking margins are compressing and fintech disruption is fierce, Geojit’s long-standing brand loyalty and HNI base have been its biggest strength. The company earns through transaction fees, mutual fund commissions, and research advisory—a model that depends heavily on scale and client stickiness.</p>
                <h3>Challenges</h3>
                <p>The challenge with Geojit is clear: in the absence of heavy tech innovation and product diversification, it may struggle to compete with new-age digital players.</p>
                <h3>Investment Perspective</h3>
                <p>However, with a clean balance sheet, dividend-paying consistency, and stable topline, it could serve as a value play in the financial services space.</p>
