            <div class="company-content">
                <h2>Dharmaj Crop Guard Ltd</h2>
                <p>Dharmaj Crop Guard is a Gujarat-based agrochemical company that manufactures, distributes, and exports pesticides, insecticides, herbicides, and fungicides. It has emerged as a fast-growing player in a sector dominated by legacy names like Bayer, Rallis, and PI Industries.</p>
                <h3>Business Strengths</h3>
                <p>The company's key strength lies in its contract manufacturing (CRAMS) and branded formulations segments, which give it flexibility across B2B and B2C models. The company's revenue mix is improving steadily with exports contributing ~30% and growing—offering a diversification edge.</p>
                <h3>Growth Factors</h3>
                <p>What makes Dharmaj attractive is its ability to scale capacity at low cost, strong product portfolio growth, and deep relationships with institutional buyers. However, working capital cycles and dependency on raw materials (largely imported from China) pose risks in margin stability.</p>
                <h3>Market Outlook</h3>
                <p>At a macro level, India’s agrarian economy and the government's push for agricultural reforms and farmer welfare bode well for agrochemical consumption. Dharmaj, being in the mid-cap category, has enough room to grow with scalability—provided it maintains its asset-light balance sheet and avoids overleveraging in pursuit of growth.</p>
