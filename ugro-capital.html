            <h1>UGRO CAPITAL</h1>
            <div class="company-content">
                <h2>Betting on India's MSME Lending Evolution</h2>
                <p>When I first came across UGRO Capital, what struck me wasn't just its focus on MSME lending—it was how it does it. This isn't your traditional NBFC chasing collateral-heavy clients. UGRO goes after small business owners running cash-based operations, assessing them on what matters most: real-time bank statements and GST data. No fancy projections. No window-dressed balance sheets. Just raw, transaction-level insights.</p>
                <h3>A Unique Lending Philosophy</h3>
                <p>Chairman Shachindra Nath has built UGRO around a very clear thesis: India’s ₹90 lakh crore MSME credit gap won't be bridged by legacy approaches. And so, UGRO is doing things differently—underwriting based on cash flows, not paper profits. This shift is powered by a tech-first approach, where platforms like MyShubhlife (MSL) enable embedded finance, helping UGRO plug into MSMEs where they already operate.</p>
                <p>As of FY25, the company’s Assets Under Management (AUM) has crossed ₹12,000 crore. That’s massive for a business that, just a few years ago, acquired a shell company (Chokhani Securities) and pivoted entirely.</p>
                <h3>What I Like: Growth with a Vision</h3>
                <p>The AUM has been compounding at 33-35% annually, even during tough quarters. Embedded finance is clearly working—₹743 crore of AUM is now routed through MSL, which also brings better yields and scale. But what excites me more is the market’s neglect. At a P/B of 0.79, UGRO is priced like a troubled asset, not a disruptor. That valuation gap, in my view, creates room for significant upside if the execution holds.</p>
                <h3>But It’s Not Without Risks</h3>
                <p>Let’s be clear: this isn’t a one-way bet.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Borrowing Costs are High:</strong> At 10.6%, it limits spread expansion, and the company doesn’t expect this to ease anytime soon.</li>
                    <li><strong>Asset Quality is a Concern:</strong> GNPA has moved up to 2.3%. While that’s not alarming for MSME-focused books, it’s still early innings for many loans, and risks could flare up fast.</li>
                    <li><strong>Profitability Lags Growth:</strong> While AUM grows >30%, profits are tracking at ~14-15% annually. For now, scale matters more than bottom-line metrics.</li>
                    <li><strong>Dilution or Debt?:</strong> UGRO is stuck in the classic NBFC loop—either raise costly debt or dilute equity. The catch: if market confidence weakens, dilution becomes value-destructive. And PE investors (who hold large chunks) may not wait around forever.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>The Make-or-Break Factors</h3>
                <p>There are some very real failure scenarios here:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>If ROA fails to scale up to the 4% target, internal capital generation may fall short.</li>
                    <li>If NPAs shoot up, even modestly, profitability could vanish due to provisioning.</li>
                    <li>If PE investors lose patience and exit en masse, stock price could spiral down further, making fundraising even tougher.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>That said, this is exactly where asymmetric bets are born.</p>
                <h3>My View</h3>
                <p>I’m invested in UGRO Capital, and yes, I might be biased. But I’m also clear-eyed about the risks. What I see here is a business challenging the status quo, with a management team that understands both lending and tech. If UGRO cracks the MSME underwriting puzzle—and avoids major asset quality blow-ups—the upside is substantial. This is not just a stock; it's a thesis on how MSME credit in India can be reinvented.</p>
                <p>But as always, execution is everything.</p>
