            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hi, I’m Jay Sejpal, a CA Finalist and CFA Level 1 candidate with a passion for understanding businesses at their core. JaySejpal.com is my personal platform where I share detailed business research, financial models, and valuation theses on listed Indian companies.

Over the years, I’ve authored over 50 research reports spanning 12+ sectors — including FMCG, IT, Retail, and Agro Chemicals — each grounded in fundamental analysis, real business dynamics, and valuation logic. My work is shaped by hands-on experience in project financing, tax compliance, and audit procedures through my articleship at a chartered accountancy firm.

This website is built for anyone who values structured, no-noise research — from investors and students to finance professionals. Here, you’ll find downloadable Excel models, valuation breakdowns, and strategic insights that go beyond the surface.

My goal is simple: to make deep business analysis accessible, practical, and valuable..</p>
