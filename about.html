            <div class="content">
                <p>Iâ€™m Jay Sejpal â€” a CA Finalist and CFA Level 1 candidate with a deep interest in finance, business models, and valuation. I created JaySejpal.com as a platform to share independent, structured research on Indian public companies â€” rooted in real-world financial logic, not just ratios.</p>
                <p>My approach is heavily influenced by long-term thinkers like Charlie Munger, whose philosophies around mental models, business quality, and rational investing have shaped the foundation of my work. One of my most-read essays explores how Munger's multidisciplinary thinking applies to analyzing Indian companies â€” from identifying durable moats to understanding capital allocation discipline.</p>
                <p><strong>On this site, youâ€™ll find:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>ðŸ“„ <strong>Research Reports</strong> analyzing company strategies, growth levers, risks, and industry positioning</li>
                    <li>ðŸ“Š <strong>Valuation Models</strong> using DCF, comparables, and other practical tools</li>
                    <li>ðŸ§¾ <strong>Excel Sheets</strong> that bring transparency to assumptions and calculations â€” fully downloadable and editable</li>
                    <li>ðŸ“š <strong>Sectoral Views</strong> that help you zoom out and spot long-term trends</li>
                </ul>
                <p>My aim is to offer clean, logic-driven analysis that empowers others â€” investors, students, analysts â€” to think more clearly and critically about businesses and valuations.</p>
